  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script for: 
        1. A general understanding of the project
        2. Steps taken in the analysis
        3. The output file.
  2. Make sure the [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called `UCI HAR Dataset`.
  3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
